# UIUC CS 418 MP 4 - A Simple Physics Engine
## Project Description
A simulation of a simple physics engine was created through use of collision detection between randomly generated particles and the walls of a container. More particles can be added or the simulation can be reset back to a state of 0 particles. Additionally, parameters that affect the particles such as gravity, drag, and a factor that affects their "bounciness" can be changed through a slider.
